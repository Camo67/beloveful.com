## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Set Up Cloudinary Credentials

You'll need your Cloudinary API credentials. If you don't have them:

1. Log in to [Cloudinary Console](https://console.cloudinary.com/)
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Find your credentials:
   - **Cloud Name:** `dvwdoezk1` (you already have this)
   - **API Key:** (found in dashboard)
   - **API Secret:** (found in dashboard)

**Set environment variables:**

```bash
export CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME='dvwdoezk1'
export CLOUDINARY_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
export CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET='your_api_secret_here'
```

To make these permanent, add them to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
echo "export CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME='dvwdoezk1'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export CLOUDINARY_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET='your_api_secret_here'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 2: Upload Images to Cloudinary

Run the upload script:

```bash
./scripts/upload-missing-countries.sh
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Upload all 178 images from the 4 missing countries
- ‚úÖ Maintain folder structure: `Website beloveful.com/{Region}/{Country}/{filename}`
- ‚úÖ Show progress for each upload
- ‚úÖ Display summary of successful/failed uploads

**Expected output:**
```

### Step 3: Import Images into Portfolio

Once uploads complete, run the Cloudinary import script:

```bash
node scripts/import-cloudinary.cjs
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Fetch all images from your Cloudinary account
- ‚úÖ Organize them by region and country
- ‚úÖ Generate updated `src/lib/data.ts` with all albums
- ‚úÖ Create a backup of your existing data.ts

**Expected output:**
```

### Step 4: Verify the Changes

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080/portfolio` and verify:

1. ‚úÖ **Africa** section now has **South Africa**
2. ‚úÖ **Europe** section now has **Portugal**
3. ‚úÖ **North America** section now has **New York** and **Cuba**
4. ‚úÖ All images display correctly
5. ‚úÖ Gallery and lightbox work properly

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cloudinary credentials not set"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if credentials are set
echo $CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
echo $CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
echo $CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET

# If empty, export them again
export CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME='dvwdoezk1'
export CLOUDINARY_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
export CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET='your_api_secret_here'
```

### Issue: Upload script fails

**Solution:**
- Verify credentials are correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure `curl` is installed: `which curl`
- Try uploading a single country first (edit script to comment out others)

### Issue: Import script doesn't detect new images

**Solution:**
- Verify images uploaded successfully to Cloudinary
- Check Cloudinary console: https://console.cloudinary.com/
- Navigate to Media Library and confirm images are there
- Wait a few minutes for Cloudinary to index new uploads
- Re-run import script

### Issue: Country doesn't appear in portfolio

**Possible causes:**
1. Folder structure in Cloudinary doesn't match expected format
2. Country code mapping in import script doesn't recognize folder name
3. Images didn't upload successfully

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what was actually uploaded
node -e "
const { v2: cloudinary } = require('cloudinary');
cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
});

cloudinary.search
  .expression('folder:Website\\\\ beloveful.com/*')
  .max_results(10)
  .execute()
  .then(result => console.log(JSON.stringify(result.resources, null, 2)));
"
```
